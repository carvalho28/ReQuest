## Using ReQuest to Gather and Analyze Requirements

ReQuest makes this easy the **user requirement definition** is the simple title 
when creating the requirement:

<br/>
<center>
![User Requirement Definition](/user-def.png)
</center>
*Figure: Adding a new requirement*


The **system requirement specification** is made inside the requirement after its creation, 
and the users have multiple tools available to create and transform as they wish, in a 
full-featured markdown editor.
