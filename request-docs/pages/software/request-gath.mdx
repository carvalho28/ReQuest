## Using ReQuest to Gather and Analyze Requirements


ReQuest makes the creation of creating a functional/non-functional requirement an easy task. 
Inside a project, just press the `+Requirement` button. You will then be asked to insert a title, 
as we can see in the figure above, this title is the
**user requirement definition** for functional requirements and a simple direct name for the non-functional.

The **system requirement specification** or the additional information for the nonfunctional
requirements is made inside the requirement after its creation. The users have multiple tools
available to create and transform the content as they wish in a full-featured markdown editor.
