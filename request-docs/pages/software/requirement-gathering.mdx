## Requirement Gathering and Analysis

This phase is crucial since it establishes the final product's concept.
If we do it wrong, the customer is unlikely to get what he expected.

Too often, there is a temptation to go directly into what is commonly referred to as "the real work", the
programming part.
Many consumers and project managers (PMs) appear to believe that genuine programming activity is what
demonstrates progress. 
However, industry experience indicates that insufficient time and effort is spent on system development
requirements-related activities. A possible outcome of this is shown in the figure below.

### What is a Requirement?

> "A **requirement** is a necessary attribute in a system, a statement that identifies a capability,
characteristic, or quality factor of a system in order for it to have value and utility to a user." - **Ralph R. Young**


### Criteria of a Good Requirement

Accordingly, to **Ralph R. Young**, each individual requirement should be:

| Characteristic                       | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Necessary                            | If the system needs it for prioritized real needs.                                                                                        |
| Feasible                             | If the requirement is achievable, within budget and schedule.                                                                             |
| Correct                              | The facts related to the requirement are accurate and it is technically and legally possible.                                             |
| Concise                              | The requirement is expressed concisely.                                                                                                   |
| Unambiguous                          | The requirement can only be understood in one way.                                                                                        |
| Complete                             | The requirement expresses a whole idea or statement.                                                                                      |
| Consistent                           | It does not conflict with any other requirement.                                                                                          |
| Verifiable                           | The requirement's implementation can be demonstrated.                                                                                     |
| Traceable                            | The origin of the requirement can be traceable throughout the system. (e.g., project, docs ...)                                           |
| Allocated                            | The requirement is assigned to a component in the system.                                                                                 |
| Design independent                   | Does not possess a specific implementation.                                                                                               |
| Nonredundant                         | It is not a duplicate requirement.                                                                                                        |
| Written using the standard construct | The requirement is stated as an imperative using **"shall"**.                                                                             |
| Assigned a unique identifier         | Each requirement shall have a unique identifying number.                                                                                  |
| Avoid of escape clauses              | The requirement should not include "if", "when", "but". Also, language should not be speculative, avoid using "usually", "generally", ... |
