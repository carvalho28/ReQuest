## Requirement Gathering and Analysis

This phase is crucial since it establishes the final product's concept.
If we do it wrong, the customer is unlikely to get what he expected.

Too often, there is a temptation to go directly into what is commonly referred to as "the real work", the
programming part.
Many consumers and project managers (PMs) appear to believe that genuine programming activity is what
demonstrates progress. 
However, industry experience indicates that insufficient time and effort is spent on system development
requirements-related activities. A possible outcome of this is shown in the figure below.

### What is a Requirement?

> "A **requirement** is a necessary attribute in a system, a statement that identifies a capability,
characteristic, or quality factor of a system in order for it to have value and utility to a user." - **Ralph R. Young**


### Criteria of a Good Requirement

Accordingly, to **Ralph R. Young**, each individual requirement should be:

| Characteristic                       | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Necessary                            | If the system needs it for prioritized real needs.                                                                                        |
| Feasible                             | If the requirement is achievable, within budget and schedule.                                                                             |
| Correct                              | The facts related to the requirement are accurate and it is technically and legally possible.                                             |
| Concise                              | The requirement is expressed concisely.                                                                                                   |
| Unambiguous                          | The requirement can only be understood in one way.                                                                                        |
| Complete                             | The requirement expresses a whole idea or statement.                                                                                      |
| Consistent                           | It does not conflict with any other requirement.                                                                                          |
| Verifiable                           | The requirement's implementation can be demonstrated.                                                                                     |
| Traceable                            | The origin of the requirement can be traceable throughout the system. (e.g., project, docs ...)                                           |
| Allocated                            | The requirement is assigned to a component in the system.                                                                                 |
| Design independent                   | Does not possess a specific implementation.                                                                                               |
| Nonredundant                         | It is not a duplicate requirement.                                                                                                        |
| Written using the standard construct | The requirement is stated as an imperative using **"shall"**.                                                                             |
| Assigned a unique identifier         | Each requirement shall have a unique identifying number.                                                                                  |
| Avoid of escape clauses              | The requirement should not include "if", "when", "but". Also, language should not be speculative, avoid using "usually", "generally", ... | 


### Types of Requirements

Since ReQuest is a Web-based Requirements Management Tool for students,
it will focus the two main types:
- functional requirements;
- nonfunctional requirements.


#### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements are an important type of requirement.
They specify what the system or program must be able to achieve.
A function is a useful capability supplied by one or more system components. 

**Example**: "The X system shall retrieve basic identifying information for 
all employees meeting the specified criteria."

##### Functional Requirements Levels


The functional requirements can also have different levels, such as:
- user requirement definition;
- system requirement specification.


| User Requirement Definition                                                                                                                                                             | System Requirement Definition                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A simple and concise definition of the requirement. It is supposed to be understood by everyone, not only engineers but also others who are not interested in implementation specifics. | A more complex definition of the requirement. It may contain various topics, each explaining what the system will do. The parties involved are usually engineers. | 


#### Nonfunctional Requirements

These are limitations on the system's services or operations. They include time restrictions, development process constraints, and standards-imposed limits. 
Nonfunctional requirements are frequently applied to the system as a whole rather than to specific system features or services.

**Example**: "The system should be easy to use by medical staff and should be organized in
such a way that user errors are minimized."


##### Metrics to Specify Nonfunctional Requirements

According to **Ian Sommerville**, the following are metrics that can be used to specify nonfunctional requirements:


| Property    | Measure                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Speed       | Processed transactions/second <br/> User/event response time <br/> Screen refresh time                                   |
| Size        | Mbytes <br/>  Number of ROM chips                                                                                        |
| Ease of Use | Training time <br/> Number of help frames                                                                                |
| Reliability | Mean time to failure <br/> Probability of unavailability <br/> Rate of failure occurrence <br/> Availability             |
| Robustness  | Time to restart after failure <br/> Percentage of events causing failure <br/> Probability of data corruption on failure |
| Portability | Percentage of target dependent statements <br/> Number of target systems                                                |
