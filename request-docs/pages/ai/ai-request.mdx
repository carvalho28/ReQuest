## AI in ReQuest

With ReQuest, we brought the power of AI to generate and validate requirements. Also, ReQuest can automatically generates functional and non-functional requirements based on the project description. It evaluates the feasibility and adherence to industry standards.

Additionally, ReQuest offers a playground feature for creating scenarios using keywords, allowing users to experiment and assess the impact of different requirements. By leveraging AI, ReQuest enhances requirement management processes, improving efficiency and accuracy in software development and project management.
