## AI Integration

### AI in Specifying Requirements

The Playground feature in ReQuest leverages the power of AI to assist students in generating requirements.
Most of the time, students are does not know how to start in writing requirements.

ReQuest uses AI to generate requirements based on the project description provided by the students. Students can generate both functional and non-functional requirements. Just click the `Unsure how to start?` button to open the generator. Then you will be prompted to enter the project description, and select the type of requirements you want to generate.

Then, the AI will then generate 5 requirements for you. You can discard the requirements that you do not want. Once you are satisfied with the requirements, you need to add due dates, and then press `Add`.

### Verification of Requirements

ReQuest also uses AI to verify the requirements written by students. When creating a new requirement, students will be provided with the
AI opinion on the requirement type (functional or non-functional). Students can then choose to accept or reject the AI opinion.
