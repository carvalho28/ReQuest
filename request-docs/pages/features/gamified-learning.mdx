## Gamified Learning

In ReQuest, we embrace the power of gamified learning to create a motivating and engaging environment for students. By integrating game elements and mechanics, we aim to enhance student motivation, increase participation, and improve knowledge retention.

Gamified learning in ReQuest involves the incorporation of game-like features, such as levels, trophies, and leaderboards. As students actively engage with the platform, they earn XP and unlock trophies based on their progress and contributions.

This gamification aspect adds a sense of challenge, competition, and accomplishment, making the learning experience more enjoyable and rewarding.
