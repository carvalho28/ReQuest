## Manage Requirements

**ReQuest** helps you efficiently handle and organize your software requirements. It provides comprehensive multiple tools and functionalities to streamline the requirement management process.

There are two main functionalities when discussing managing requirements: `projects` and `requirements`.

In the [Projects](/features/manage-requirements/projects), you can create projects, define their details such as name, description, deadline, and invite coworkers to collaborate with you.

In the [Requirements](/features/manage-requirements/requirements) you can add and manage requirements within your projects.

This way, with ReQuest's Manage Requirements feature, you can effectively collaborate with your team, track changes, and visualize the progress of your requirements.
