## Engineering

> "Engineering is the art of directing the great
sources of power in nature for the use and convenience 
of man." - **Thomas Tredgold**

With the quote above in mind, engineering is the process of developing cost-effective solutions to issues by making efficient use of all resources, including time and money.

Software engineering is all this process toward software, as we will see below.

### What is Software Engineering?

The process of **designing**, **testing**, and **maintaining** software, 
is known as software engineering. It entails applying principles of computer 
science, engineering, and project management to create high-quality software 
that satisfies the needs of consumers.

### Steps to Follow in the Process

1. [Requirement Gathering and Analysis](/software/requirement-gathering)
2. System Design
3. Coding and Development
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

[ReQuest](https://re-quest.vercel.app/) focuses on the requirements
engineering part and its analysis. This part is crucial since it focuses 
on what the client wants or, as students, what the intended goals of a given
project are.
