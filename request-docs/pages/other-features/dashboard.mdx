### Forecast Accuracy

The forecast accuracy in requirement management is determined by the probability of ending a project on time. This metric considers two factors:

- days remaining until the deadline relative to the total project duration: (days remaining / total days);
- completion ratio of project requirements: (completed requirements + 1) / (total requirements + 1).

The complete formula is:

<div className="mt-6 rounded border border-gray-200 p-4 dark:border-gray-900 text-center text-lg">
$$\text{FC} = \frac{\text{drud}}{\text{tdp}} \times \frac{\text{cp} + 1}{\text{tr} + 1}$$
</div>

Where:

- `FC` is the forecast accuracy;
- `drud` is the days remaining until the deadline;
- `tdp` is the total days of the project;
- `cp` is the number of completed requirements;
- `tr` is the total number of requirements.
