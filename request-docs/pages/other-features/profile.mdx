## Profile

Inside the profile, you can see your `avatar`, your `name`, your `tag`(based on level), your `xp` and your `level`.
You can also see all of your projects and the users you have connected with, which means all the users you have a project with.

You can also change your name and customize your avatar at any time.

### Avatar

ReQuest has a built-in avatar system. You can make the avatar of your liking using the `n` combinations possible.
You can then update your avatar, or even download it.
