## Calendar

The calendar in ReQuest offers a visual and intuitive way to manage your requests and projects. It allows you to:

- visualize deadlines and milestones at a glance;
- plan and schedule your work effectively.

This feature enables you to easily see the deadlines and milestones associated with your requests and projects. It provides a color-coded representation of events, helping you prioritize tasks and manage your time efficiently.
